              Dhaka Division is the administrative, political, and economic
              heart of Bangladesh. Located in the central part of the country,
              it is the most densely populated division and home to the capital
              city, Dhaka. The division plays a vital role in national
              governance, finance, education, and culture. Major rivers such as
              the Buriganga, Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna flow through the region,
              supporting agriculture, trade, and transportation. Dhaka Division
              is known for its rich history, with notable sites like Lalbagh
              Fort, Ahsan Manzil, Sonargaon, and Panam Nagar reflecting its
              Mughal and colonial heritage. The area is also a hub for
              industries including garments, banking, technology, and commerce.
              With a blend of ancient history and rapid urban development, Dhaka
              Division represents both the traditional roots and modern progress
              of Bangladesh.

              Bangladesh and is widely known for its agricultural productivity
              and historical heritage. The region is often called the “food

              farmland. Rajshahi Division is rich in history, featuring ancient

              Rajshahi University being one of the largest public universities
              in Bangladesh. Known for its relatively dry climate and peaceful
              environment, Rajshahi Division plays an important role in
